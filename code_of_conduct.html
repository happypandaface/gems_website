GEMS Code of Conduct<br/>
GEMS is a student led organization with the goal of fostering community for game development. As student group of PSU, we are bound by rules that govern all student groups as well as those determined by this code of conduct. <br/>
 <br/>
Participants<br/>
Anyone associated with GEMS in any way, including all members, officers, participants, attendees, speakers, sponsors, volunteers, or staff, is subject to this Code of Conduct while they are participating in the GEMS community, including attending any event organized by GEMS, using any GEMS media channels, or communicating with or about other people associated with GEMS.<br/>
Inclusion<br/>
GEMS is dedicated to providing an inclusive, welcoming, and safe environment for everyone. Participants must be considerate of others and behave in a professional and respectful manner. GEMS invites all Participants to help further these values.<br/>
Unacceptable Behavior<br/>
No unacceptable behavior of any kind will be tolerated. This also applies to games or content created or shared in the GEMS community. Participants asked to stop any unacceptable behavior are expected to comply immediately.<br/>
Unacceptable behavior includes sexism, racism, discrimination, disruptive behavior, harassment, and exclusion of any kind.<br/>
Reporting<br/>
If you experience or notice any unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the GEMS staff immediately. GEMS treats all reports as confidential and asks that Participants avoid disclosing information about an incident until GEMS has addressed the situation.<br/>
Resolution<br/>
If GEMS determines, either by observation or complaint, that a Participant has violated this Code of Conduct, GEMS may take any action it deems appropriate, including warning the offender, expelling the offender from the event without a refund, or temporarily or permanently suspending the offender from future events or online discussion.<br/>
All determinations of unacceptable behavior are in GEMSâ€™s sole discretion and its decisions are final. <br/>

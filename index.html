Members are encouraged to show off games they have made or are currently working on. Snacks and refreshments included<br/>
<br/>
Asset Day (Oct 19th?)<br/>
Come make resources for future games with the perfect place to try a new skill or work on ideas that you have had in the back of your mind. A theme will decided and members will create sprites, models, music, sound effects, shaders or whatever else you may want to contribute to future games. Lunch and drinks will be provided. <br/>
<br/>
Talks (Nov ?)<br/>
GEMS will host a talk by a member of the games industry from outside of PSU. A number of people who have expressed interest in giving a talk.<br/>
Current possible speakers:<br/>
Marlowe Dobbe http://marlowe.dobbe.com/<br/>
Kevin Johns https://lucidsheepgames.com/<br/>
Dylan Bennett (head of the Portland Unity group)<br/>
<br/>
GameJam (Nov 9th)<br/>
I personally am interested in holding a game jam during the weekend of the 9th <br/>
<br/>
Recurring:<br/>
Weekly coworking space: <br/>
Every week there will be a time and space for members to meet up work on projects, discuss works in progress or just ask work on their courses. <br/>
<br/>
Leadership meetings:<br/>
Meetings for planning and implementation will happen throughout the year with a greater focus on making them accessible for those who live far from campus or canâ€™t make it during time conflicts. Meetings will be held every two weeks. Time is TBD.<br/>

<br/>
Here are some details from our previous events (we will remember to take pictures at future events!)<br/>
Unity Workshop: Saturday 2/16/19: "Workshop led by Dylan Bennet, PIGsquad board member, Portland Unity Group, and Super Green Games.
